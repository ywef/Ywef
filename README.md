### About me

I'm Youssef, a developer from Cairo. I like to play around with projects like  [palera1n](https://github.com/palera1n/palera1n) and [Permasigner](https://github.com/permasigner/permasigner). My favorite programming languages are Python, Typescript, and Astro, and I'm trying to get better at all 3 while learning a little C too.

If you need to contact me, you can do so at `youssefsaleh2610@gmail.com`. If this is some sort of security issue or private information, please encrypt your email with [my GPG key]

If you want to know more about the languages and tools I use, please look at my [instagram]

If you'd like to support me, you can send me a support message.
